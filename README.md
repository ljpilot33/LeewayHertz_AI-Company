* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  Issues stemming from inefficient manual processes, human errors, and a lack of real time data.

  The manufacturing industry has long faced various challenges, including process inefficiencies, production errors, 
  and costly machine maintenance.

  These issues stem from inefficiencies in manual processes, human errors, and a lack of real-time insights, resulting 
  in escalated expenses, compromised quality, and missed opportunities. 

  One of the primary obstacles manufacturing plant faces is accurately detecting faults in the production process. 
  Traditional methods often rely on simplistic procedures that fail to identify and resolve production issues 
  effectively. https://www.leewayhertz.com/ai-use-cases-in-manufacturing/

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

  Some industry organizations will require an Installation Operation Qualification (IOQ) as well as a Performance Qualification (PQ).
  Offering a vetted protocol to “test/challenge” the data and AI programming for accuracy and reliability. Resulting in a report on
  findings for traceability.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  The benefit of having a deliverable available for the customer when providing AI or Machine Learning (ML) solutions, the
  protocol representing test/response challenge will assist in a debugging of the system in a systematic process. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  The technologies the IOQ will use are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to, first, verify the
  robustness of the IOQ, and second, yielding a better assessment of the protocol results accuracy.

  AI is making possible much more precise manufacturing process design, as well as problem diagnosis and resolution when
  defects crop up in the fabrication process, by using a digital twin. A digital twin is an exact virtual replica of the
  physical part, the machine tool, or the part being made.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  By harnessing AI’s capabilities, manufacturing companies can overcome hurdles such as fault detection, error reduction, and maintenance          optimization. AI’s capacity to learn from vast datasets can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of production cycles,             diminishing the need for manual intervention in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, AI-powered analytics equip organizations with tools that     enable them to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance inventory management. As per Precedence Research, the global   market for AI in manufacturing reached a value of USD 3.8 billion in 2022. It is projected to attain approximately USD68.36 billion by 2032,     experiencing a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% from 2023 to 2032.
